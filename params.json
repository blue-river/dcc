{"name":"Dcc","body":"### DCC\r\n\r\nDCC is a fast optimizing compiler for the DC language, targeting the [DCPU-16](http://0x10c.com/doc/dcpu-16.txt).\r\nDC is a language with a simple C-like syntax. \r\n\r\nA DC program consists of the .dc source files in the current directory, along with source files in any specified module search path. Each .dc source file contains the code for the module with the same name.\r\n\r\nThis is a simple DC program showing the syntax:\r\n\r\n```\r\nint foo = 4;\r\nint answer;\r\n\r\nvoid main()\r\n{\r\n    int bar;\r\n\r\n    bar = 3;\r\n\r\n    while (foo != 2)\r\n    {\r\n        foo = bar;\r\n        bar--;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    doTheFoo(foo);\r\n    \r\n    setAnswer(&answer);\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid doTheFoo(int bar)\r\n{\r\n    foo = bar + 2;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid setAnswer(int answer)\r\n{\r\n    *answer = 42;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### DC language\r\n\r\nThe basic unit of compilation is a module. Compilation starts with the `main` module, which must contain the `main` function.\r\n\r\nTo access methods from another module, prefix their name with the module name and a period.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\nDCC requires Python 2.7 and PLY. PLY can be installed using `easy_install ply`.\r\n\r\nAdd the DCC directory to the `PATH` to use dcc.py easily in any directory.","tagline":"A fast optimizing compiler targeting the DCPU-16.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
